      "title": "Trump, Putin, Jimmy Kimmel: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing",
      "abstract": "1. President Trump’s push to get a new health care bill through the House was dealt a huge blow by an influential Republican who refused to support it. The lawmaker said it “torpedoes” protections for people with pre-existing conditions, who are also speaking out against the bill — and so is the late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. He gave a moving monologue about his newborn son, Billy, who has a heart defect. Above, Mr. Kimmel and his wife, Molly McNearney, in February. Speaker Paul Ryan offered no indication when a vote might be held. Video from police body cameras could be crucial in the investigation into a fatal police shooting of a 15-year-old in Texas. After an internal investigation, the chief of the Balch Springs Police Department said the officer who opened fire was dismissed from the force. Prosecutors could also bring charges. Jordan Edwards was in a car leaving the area of a house party east of Dallas on Saturday night when he was shot in the head. The officers had been responding to reports of underage drinking. Jordan’s family released a statement saying his brothers “witnessed firsthand his violent, senseless murder” and asking people to refrain from protests in his name.",
